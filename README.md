MOTOR ASSEMBLY MONITORING THROUGH IMAGE ANALYSIS

PROBLEM STATEMENT: The project focuses on developing an image analysis system to monitor the correct insertion of magnets into the rotor slots of a motor during assembly. Additionally, it includes a 3D surface scanning component to evaluate the surface roughness and depth variability of the motor post-assembly. The goal is to leverage advanced computer vision techniques to automate quality control processes, thereby reducing the reliance on manual inspections and enhancing overall production efficiency.
